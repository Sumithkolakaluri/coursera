                <h2>Suresh Raina</h2>
                <p>
                   Often called Mr. IPL, Suresh Raina has truly aced the IPL. Raina has been the talisman for the Chennai Super Kings over the years. In nine of the 12 seasons, Raina has aggregated 400-plus runs. His lowest return was 374 runs, in 2015. With an aggregate of 5,368 runs, he is the tournament’s second highest run-scorer. Averaging 33.34, he has hit 38 fifties and one century, with an overall strike rate of 137.14. Raina missed his first IPL match only in the ninth season due to the birth of his first child. He scored 442 runs  Often called ‘Chinna Thala’ by the locals of Tamil Nadu, Raina truly is a urban legend for the franchise.
However, he in a rather unceremonious way returned to India from Dubai just before the start of IPL 2020.
